# History
1. The continent of Wizora is roughly 4000 miles from east coast to west coast. From south coast north is around 2000 miles until one start to enter tundra and sub artic terrain. Although the empire lays claim to the entire continent it is not known whether the empire has any outpost north of the tree line only a few in the government would know. Most of the continent has a temperate climate. The further north you travel the longer and harsher the winters become. The reverse holds true as you move south; the winters become shorter and less harsh. The southern coast receives little to no snow but is subject to tropical storms in the early spring and late fall. These storms can bring heavy rains and hurricane force winds. The west coast is very similar to the south coast except as you move north up the coast in winter one will encounter snow and artic storms. Icebergs can also pose a threat in the winter and spring of the year. The east coast is similar to the west coast except that as you travel south the climate becomes subtropical to tropical.

    The Thravarian people arrived on the southern coast well over a thousand years ago. Over the short period of ten years with the use of diplomacy and military might they were able to wrest control of Wizora from the elves. The dwarven kingdoms seeing an opportunity for trade and a chance to avoid war signed diplomatic alliances. Besides the dwarves never really liked the elves anyway. Within another twenty years the dwarves had joined the Thravarian empire. The orc tribes seeing the military might of the new comers joined them immediately. The orc now had a powerful allies to help them defeat their hated enemy the elves. The orcs became the first race on Wizora to join what was to become the Thravarian Empire. An honour they are proud of still to this day as orcs hold positions throughout the empire. As elven control slowly slipped away more and more races joined the empire. The once proud elves now only hold two known forests kingdoms on the west of the continent which are under constant surveillance. Elven bounty- The Empire has a standing bounty of 50gp for any elf dead or alive. Dark elves are excluded from this bounty. The Empire offers a place within its lands to any race as long as it adheres to the laws. Due to this tolerance one can often find what one would normally consider monster race working or running business. Slaver = yes slaver is legal in the empire.

    True elves were immune to the Grey Death. This has led to the rise of the old predigests and a bounty was reinstated on the elves. They have once again retreated to their own lands to defend their boarders. After 15 years of war few demons survive and mass warfare slowly ground to a halt. Small bands of demon hunters still roam the land searching for survivors. Five years later the emperor imposed the great edict imperium magicus. The edict stated that all magic item were to be surrendered to the emperor. For the next 7 years magic hunters scoured the land with the aid of creatures known as Seekers collecting magical items and returning them to the Imperial city. What the emperor wanted with them few if any knew. On the first day of the New Year a terrible explosion destroyed part of the imperial palace. The emperor could not be found and it is assumed he was killed in the ensuing explosion and fire. One of the first acts of the new emperor was to repeal the great edict and restoring to the people the right to possess magical items.
