# Description
Very little is known about Ozmodias' past. According to his own statements, he became an agent for the Raven Queen a long time ago, gaining eternal life in return for his memories and likely a few other concessions.
Bits and pieces of his memories seem to resurface from time to time, allowing him insight into the past but for the most part, he has only a vague recollection of past events if any. He has a habit of forgetting people's names and faces as well, though I wonder if that is merely is old age showing. While his age is unclear, it is safe to assume he is at least a thousand years old from what little he seems to remember here and there. Oddly enough, he has no recollection of the invasion despite it being such a large event. It is as if he was not present during that time.

> [!info]- Personal opinion
> Knowledge is sacred. Memories are a key to gaining future knowledge. They make us who we are. I do not understand why anyone would willingly follow a goddess hungry for your memories. Such trades stifle your potential and, if taken to the extreme like in his case, make you a puppet of a higher being. Maybe he sees this as an honor, to me this is just sad.
