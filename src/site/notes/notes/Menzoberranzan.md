## Description
Built into a network of large caverns in the [[Underdark\|Underdark]], [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] is the defacto capital of Drow society and its largest known city state.
The streets of [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] are paved in dark obsidian. Gently glowing stones line the sidewalks, providing a dim, slightly purple, ambient lighting, enough for the local Drow population to see but still allowing for plenty of opportunity for shady deals and machinations to occur. The sounds of clashing weapons and spells can usually be heard in the distance no matter where one goes in the city. There is no neutrality in this city, [[notes/Menzoberranzan noble houses\|Menzoberranzan noble houses]] are either allied or engaged in war, whether it be hot or cold.
A deep, damp, earthy smell permeates most of the city, intermixed with the scent of aging stone and decay and only overpowered by sweet spices near the markets and kitchens.

## Fashion
The drow inhabitants of the city prefer long, flowy garments, usually detailed with spider motifs to show their allegiance to the Spider Queen [[notes/Lolth\|Lolth]]. 

## Slavery
Drow keep a large population of slaves in [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]], likely outnumbering the Drow by this point. Drow enslave any race that is not their own, though they mainly consist of Goblins, Kobolds, Orcs and Bugbears with a few Humans and even less elves and other rarer races.

> [!note]- Personal Opinion
> I wish we had this back in the Empire. Compulsory eduction is a net benefit to society.
## Main Market
One of the few neutral zones of [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]], the main market is most famous for its wide range of merchants and slavers.
