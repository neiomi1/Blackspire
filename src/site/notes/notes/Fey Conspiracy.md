## Conspirators
- [[notes/House T'will\|House T'will]], [[notes/Zebeyica Everhund\|Zebeyica Everhund]]
- [[Klenas\|Klenas]]
- [[Zusog\|Zusog]]
- [[Malabog\|Malabog]]

## Goal
This conspiracy aims to attack the City of [[notes/Astrazalian\|Astrazalian]] in the Feywild in order to establish a foothold in the plane.

## Activities
### Fey Kidnappings
A group of drow around [[notes/House T'will\|House T'will]] has begun kidnapping and buying Fey creatures for the last months. In the process of setting up a laboratory on an abandoned, forgotten island south-east of [[notes/Blackwharf\|Blackwharf]], they destroyed a merchant company associated with [["The Duchess"\|"The Duchess"]]. The laboratory was used to extract blood, first and foremost. Experiments seem to have taken place elsewhere.
There is a standing order for Fey creatures and blood in [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] in their name as well. 

## Cold Iron Research
Fey blood is used by [[notes/Zebeyica Everhund\|Zebeyica Everhund]] to research Cold Iron weaponry, a metal especially effective against Fey. These weapons are to be provided to [[Malabog\|Malabog]] and his men, giants hell-bent on revenge against the Feywild, specifically [[notes/Astrazalian\|Astrazalian]].
