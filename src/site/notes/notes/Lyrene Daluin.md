# Description 


# Abilities
A ranger of the Underdark, Lyrene is very competent with her bow as well as being especially knowledgeable when it comes to the area around her home [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]]. She has managed to track her husband [[notes/Eltanin Luneiros\|Eltanin Luneiros]] on the surface in the hostile territory of the Empire despite him traveling throughout the southern Empire without any clear indications to where he and his companions would travel next.

# Appendix
- Lyrene appears to miss someone dearly
- Allying with Lyrene should prove possible though she doubts our ability to survive in [[notes/Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] and play the political game
