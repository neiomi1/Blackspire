# Description
A short, wiry drow with white hair and freckles, Eltanin is not the most imposing figure. He lacks greatly in self-confidence and needs affirmation of those around him. This seems to be due to his drow upbringing for the most part but he has been getting better at weathering pushbacks. 
Eltanin is a cleric of Eilistraee and prays to her guiding stars every night.
>[!info]- Personal opinion
Eltanin believes his goddess has brought us together. I don't know whether that is the case but we both need each other. I have no trouble imagining a future together, whether it be working in silence side by side or raising a family. So far he has only blushed at the mention of children, however.
