# Description
The exact purpose of the edict is lost to time. Historians believe it to be a direct reaction to the [[notes/Demon Invasion\|Demon Invasion]]. Whether it was meant to prevent another similar conflict or to quickly stabilize the government is unclear, however for seven years after its approval, magic hunters began to scour the empire for magic items and artifacts and sending them back to the capital.
On the first day of 1907 (More commonly known as 0 NA), the magic items interfered with each other, causing a large explosion that rocked the imperial palace of [[notes/Neverfell\|Neverfell]], most likely killing the emperor. The ascent of his successor is commonly referred to as the beginning of the New Age.
