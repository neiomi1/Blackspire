The **Demon Invasion** was fought from 1885 to 1900 between the powers of [[notes/Wizoria\|Wizoria]], most namely the [[notes/Thravarian Empire\|Thravarian Empire]] and [[Elven Dominion\|Elven Dominion]] and a demon army of unknown origin. Both purpose and any exact timeline have not been recorded or are not privy to the public. 

During the war, the cities of [[Highstrand \|Highstrand ]]and [[Stormholme Castle\|Stormholme Castle]] were fully destroyed whereas [[notes/Blackspire\|Blackspire]] was barely defended, changing in the tide of war in favor of the defending people of [[notes/Wizoria\|Wizoria]].

# End of the war
## Long-term effects
Large portions of the countryside were razed to the ground in the [[notes/Thravarian Empire\|Thravarian Empire]]. What was not lost to the demon army would be lost to hunger. A lot of written history was lost in the conflict as well as a large portion of magically gifted citizens. Together with the [[notes/Edict Imperium Magicus\|Edict Imperium Magicus]], magic has become a rare commodity in the [[notes/Thravarian Empire\|Thravarian Empire]] in the present time, mostly concentrated around the magic city of [[notes/Starkeep\|Starkeep]] with its many magic schools and towers.
