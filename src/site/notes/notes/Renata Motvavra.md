# History
While traveling back to [[notes/Blackspire\|Blackspire]] with a personal guard, Renata encountered the [[notes/Orphan Herders\|Orphan Herders]] in an inn. A stranger named Killian kidnapped her during the knight, killing her guard and leaving a symbol drawn in blood on the wall - that of a skeleton, holding a skull with it's left hand and a sickle with its right on the wall.

Renata was subsequently held captive by the reemerged [[Blood Root Cult\|Blood Root Cult]], trained for an upcoming sacrifice at winter solistice. After two failed attempts, the [[notes/Orphan Herders\|Orphan Herders]] managed to rescue her from her captors and reunite her with her father [[notes/Mesher Motvavra\|Mesher Motvavra]]
