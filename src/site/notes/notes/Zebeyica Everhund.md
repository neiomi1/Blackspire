# Description 


# Abilities
Assumed to be an archwizard of one of the highest levels attainable by mortals. Her full power has not been displayed as of yet but her knowledge and ability to research as well as description by others lead me to believe that she is somewhere around or above the 15th Circle 

## Spells
### Known Spells
- Glyph of Warding
- Delayed Blast Fireball
- Teleport
### Unknown Spells
#### Necrotic Gas
A spell to instantly spread a non-moving cloud of gas in a circle about 40ft in diameter. The gas is non-toxic though has necromantic properties, causing necrotic damage to those lingering inside of it, doing almost as much damage as the Disintegrate spell from what little I have observed it.


# Agenda
Zebeyica is currently researching a way to make cold iron. She has been capturing Fey to harvest their blood for her research, ultimately intending on aiding or launching an invasion into the Fey Wild itself, wanting to take over one of its largest cities, perhaps as a foothold for further incursions.

# Appendix
- It is a bit odd that she serves [[notes/House T'will\|House T'will]] and not [[notes/House Baenre\|House Baenre]] given her abilities
