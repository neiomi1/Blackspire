## Elven bounty
The Empire has a standing bounty of 50gp for any elf dead or alive. Dark elves are excluded from this bounty. The Empire offers a place within its lands to any race as long as it adheres to the laws. Due to this tolerance one can often find what one would normally consider monster race working or running business.
